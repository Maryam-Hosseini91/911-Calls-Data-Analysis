## Introduction:
In this project I will be analyzing some calls to 911 (emergency calls) in Montgomery County Pennsylvania, the data is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert).

## Purpose:
Here are some questions or insights that I would like to obtain from the data by using my data analysis skills.
* From where the calls come most?
* Which are the top townships for calls?
* How many unique titles?
* What is the reason for most calls?
* What is the most common time for calls?
#### Please refer to 911 Calls Data Analysis.ipynb for detailed information.
